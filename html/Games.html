		<h1>Videogames I play and love</h1>
			<h2>Skyrim</h2>
				<p>Skyrim is one of my favourite games of all time. Athough it is sometimes pretty hard to play because of my pretty 
				   crappy laptop, it is an awesome game with more interesting side quests then the main quest in most other games.
				   I have to admit, I only did the first part of the main quest (the first 20 min), now i haven´t saved the world, but i´m a 
				   student of wizardry, a companion and a member of the thief guild which is pretty cool.
				   Although it quite old for a videogame (published 2011) it is still one of the best ( probably on place 2 after 
				   "The Witcher III wild hunt")</p> 
		
			<h2>The Sims 4</h2>
				<p>The Sims is one of the most played videogames in the world, and i think it deserves it. It may not have a universal story, 
			       but the cool thing about The Sims is that you can invent your own stories no matter how crazy they are. E.g. I once had a vampire
			       who baked really much, which is pretty useless because Vampires don´t have to eat human food, and than  i let her put it in 
			       a public spot, so everybody could eat it. Also maybe so that the people didn´t buy so much from the food trucks.
			    
			<h2>Lego Marvel Avengers</h2>
				<p>My favorite Logo Game. I just love the lego humour. It is amazing. Sometimes in story i had to laugh so hard, I nearly dropped 
			       my controller. And that means something because I love my controller.
			       More then one year after I bought it i am almost finished. I have 98% now, but i really want to finish it completely, because i 
			       made a bet/challenge with myself that i wouldn´t buy Lego marvel Superheroes 2 before i finished it 100%. But i think it won´t
			       be possible b.c. one golden brick just isn´t there, therefore I think i will be stuck at 99,9% which wold suck. I think I would 
			       cont this as 100% so i could still buy Lego marvel Superheroes </p>
